# MusTrack

MusTrack is a very simple app to scrobble your live music on stream!

## Requirements
1) A [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org/) account.
2) [Web Scrobbler](https://web-scrobbler.com/) already installed.

## Setup without download.

1) Open web scrobbler options and link your ListenBrainz account.
2) Go to [Mustrack](https://mustrack.nightdarkness.com/) webpage and search your ListenBrainz username.
3) Now copy the url and add it on your OBS or streaming tool like a browser media (i recommend a resolution of 800px by 200px).

Now you can scrobble your music in your stream!
